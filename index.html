              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>
                The definition of development is very subjective to each community and ecosystem which is the reason we cannot generalize it to a global standard as cities, towns and villages all have their own target. 
                The World Bank uses around 1000 development indicators in its World Development Indicators Database. Along with this there are also multiple indices used by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), also the new Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) used to compare countries for ranking.
                I think considering Gross National Happiness (GNH) to be more important than Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as GDP measures only the economic value and doesn’t look at the bigger picture. There is no reason in having all the money in the world and not be happy.<br>
                Some of the questions I asked was<br>
                Which indicator serves best to asses development and modernity?<br>
                Is higher income more important than leisure time and better health?<br> 
                Does higher income necessarily make people happy?<br>

              <h4 class="title">Social interaction and Community wellbeing</h4>
              <p class="description">From the different people I talk to and the stories I heard, there are a smaller number of people who all know each other, comparing that to the city where nobody lives in a joint family anymore and all relatives live in a different city or area. This gap in distance, the overwhelming city life creates a void in their relationship as they are exhausted by the end of the day and always in a hurry in the morning which reduces communication with their family. Moreover, most of the social interaction in the city are through online communication unlike in the Banni where it is direct human-human interaction as they all live close by.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

              <h4 class="title">Education</h4>
              <p class="description">The people in Banni had extensive knowledge about their surroundings and were able the answer any question we asked them. This was one of my major take away when Ramzan said that we have only book knowledge and nothing of our surroundings, he also said that have formal education is not bad but we also need to study our surroundings. This makes us question the definition of education. The standard of education is defined by western powers when they ruled over the Indian subcontinent but India unlike the western powers follows a completely different culture. Education not necessarily mean formal degree and learning from a textbook in the classroom. But when we talked to some of the people, we talked also wanted to go to a formal education school.</p>

              <h4 class="title">Self-sufficient and sustainable</h4>
              <p class="description">People in the Banni are definitely more sustainable and very self-sufficient compared to us in cities as we tend to overuse the resources. Over in the Banni all the houses were made of mud, straw, cow dung etc. which are all-natural degradable material and earthquake resistant which shows a lot of planning has gone into it. They also have water shortage in the Banni which is why they are very cautious on the water spent but people in the cities don’t realize it as its all given by the city corporation. Of course, they are not completely self-sufficient as I did see products not belonging or made by their community which they had to rely on other companies. There can also not be hundred percent sustainability as that’s not possible because as ease of living increases, sustainability decreases.</p>

              <h4 class="title">Health </h4>
              <p class="description">Access to healthcare is very low as most of the people in the Banni have to travel to towns for the hospital. We were staying in Hodka which means Bhuj the district capital was the nearest town. Compared to that people in the cities have easy access to healthcare as there are a high density of hospital but the question is how often do people fall sick? People in the Banni would be healthier as the amount of pollution is drastically low compared to cities. They also don’t have the stressful life which is present in the cities as heard one person say “People in the cities are chasing after something but nobody knows what they are chasing after”. People living in the Banni also have a better immune system compared to people in city as they live in this extreme climate where it gets too cold in the night and too hot in the day.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4 wow bounceInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s" data-wow-duration="1.4s">

              <h4 class="title">Happiness</h4>
              <p class="description">Many countries in the world are considering happiness to be a more important factor than just economic value. When we asked the Maldharis on what they want, they replied by saying that they are happy with what they have and all they want is to be left alone. I am not trying to say that they don’t have any trouble, every person has their own set of problems and so do the Maldharis. Other people we talked to had other aims like one person wanted to start a mechanic shop and also needed a gas station near his village so they don’t have the trouble of going long distance for gas. People in the city have other troubles like pollution, high stress, traffic, noise pollution and they also have lower immunity but that’s not to say that people are not happy in the city as there is obviously the factor of ease of living which makes people happy and creates the pull factor where people migrate to the city.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4 wow bounceInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s" data-wow-duration="1.4s">
            <div class="box">
              <div class="icon" style="background: #ecebff;"><i class="ion-ios-clock-outline" style="color: #8660fe;"></i></div>
              <h4 class="title">Leisure time</h4>
              <p class="description">People in the Banni have a very flexible schedule compared to the daily routine of the people in the cities. I can’t really calculate how much leisure time they had for the same reason but again a question arises that if they really need leisure time or not? For instance, from my experience, people in the city wake up and are always in a hurry as we never know how bad the traffic is and after working long hours and also putting overtime with the huge amount of pollution makes people very tired and unhealthy. We had one day with the Maldharis where we started in the morning by following them and their herd, we then camped with them in evening and had a nice conversation around the fire. It is hard to say how much free time they have but when asked they said they have a lot. I feel that leisure time is the most important parameter as there is no use chasing money when people can’t relax.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4 wow bounceInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s" data-wow-duration="1.4s">
            <div class="box">
              <div class="icon" style="background: #ecebff;"><i class="ion-ios-albums-outline" style="color: #8660fe;"></i></div>
              <h4 class="title">Capital</h4>
              <p class="description">It is true that happiness is more important than money and money can only buy momentary happiness but money is and integral part to sustain life in the current world. For instance, the Maldharis we met had a herd of around 150-200 livestock and their annual revenue is around Rs 2.4 Cr for 10 families and subtracting Rs 9 Lac per month for expenses, each family gets around Rs 1.1 Lac per month. From my personal experiences, I have heard people living in the city who earn around Rs 20,000 per month. Seeing the absolute value, Rs 1.1 Lac is less as compared to the per capita income but it also depends on the cost of living also. The cost of living in cities clearly being higher makes me think that people in the Banni might be richer than some of the people in the city.</p>

          <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4 wow bounceInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s" data-wow-duration="1.4s">

              <div class="icon" style="background: #ecebff;"><i class="ion-ios-analytics-outline" style="color: #8660fe;"></i></div>
              <h4 class="title">Human rights</h4>
              <p class="description">It is a very tricky topic as the I feel all the government cares about is turning the Banni grasslands into a forest and now selling the land rights to factors. By these actions I feel that the Government of India doesn’t care about the opinion of the Maldharis who have been living in the Banni for hundreds of years. But at the same time the Maldharis have come together and formed a committee known as the Banni Breeders Association (BBA) and have legally petitioned the decision taken up by the government and the case is still open in the Supreme Court.</p>

              Applying these parameters on a numerical scale is very difficult as most of them cannot be quantified. There is also no possible way for me to conclude that Kutch is more developed than a metropolitan but neither can I conclude that it is underdeveloped. As mentioned before each system has different parameters and aims which cannot be globalized. In any case there cannot be a perfect world and each system will have its pros and cons. The Maldharis too, like us are connected to the rest of the world through high speed internet, they receive newspaper, listen to radio and watch live tv on mobile but after putting some though into it we concluded that it is really not necessary for them to stay connected as it doesn’t even matter for them. They also live a more sustainable life compared to people in the city but that means that their ease of living is scientifically lower. As ease of living increases, sustainability decreases.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
              They also have a relatively lower cost of living than the cost of living in the cities but at the same time breeding livestock is unpredictable as there many factors like rain, milk yield, grass growth, fodder etc. which are not constant. This is also true in education as everyone thinks that formal education or western education is the standard but as we all know that formal education is not really necessary to gain knowledge. The Maldharis have amazing knowledge about their surroundings which I feel is very important that people need to know what’s going on around them, practical learning and use of the knowledge is more important than theoretical which is what the formal education does.<br>
              In most of these parameters the Maldharis might be leading compared to the people in the city but the city also has its own parameters and objectives. Cities are known for their easy life fueled by technology but that’s where it lacks sustainability which the Maldharis are.
